                <p>Programer / Student</p>
                <p>When I set foot in Technological Institute of the Philippines for the first time, I already knew that things were not going to be smooth sailing—both literally
and metaphorically. There were long jeepney rides; seemingly endless
stopovers; and exhaustion from commuting daily. Every morning, sitting through the bumpy roads, watching the city rush by, I realized that this was more than just a physical journey—it was a test of patience, perseverance, and commitment.

It is not easy, but TIP became more than just a school to me. It became a place where I met incredible people classmates who turned into friends, professors who inspired me, and individuals who shared the same drive to learn and grow. Each day, I am grateful for the connections I make, the lessons I absorb, and the experiences that shape me into the person I aspire to be.

Along the way, I found something I didn't really prepare for things like in personal growth. Balancing academics, responsibilities, and social life called for efficiency and organization of activities and time.
Managing one's time well, handling tasks, and taking charge of one's learning transformed me into a more responsible person instead of just "going with the flow." Now, I know exactly how to make every
effort contribute to furthering my progress. The struggles that once felt overwhelming became opportunities to improve, proving that growth comes from the little steps taken every day.

This is just the start. The road ahead is long, and the journey through this institution will be filled with countless lessons, victories, and obstacles. But no matter how tough it gets, I remind myself that every step every ride, every late-night study session, every new friendship is part of something bigger.
And so, my story at TIP continues. The journey has just begun.

                <h3>Marty Alejandro Sta Ana</h3>
                <p>Programmer / Student</p>
                <p> Hello there! I am Marte Alejandro B. Sta. Ana, a current student at the Technological Institute of the Philippines. I am a new transferee student this current semester with the aim of taking up a brand-new direction in my life in pursuing the IT program. Before my transfer, I was a student at DLSU Manila for 6 years. I pursued at an Electronics Engineering degree in that institution and had a breadth of experiences in my time there. From the top-notch facilities, to the diverse amount personalities I had as my classmates, along with the many activities being held, the experience was certainly a bustling school life. However, I also had a number of struggles like the long commute, the busy schedules, and the pandemic which led to very heavy loss of motivation of working towards that degree. I had the difficult decision choosing not to continue my studies in DLSU despite being eligible to shift towards other programs. 
It was my father who recommended that I enroll in TIP. Being an engineer and also a member of the Institute of Integrated Electrical Engineers of the Philippines (IIEE), he noted that the graduates he met from the school were excellent colleagues and were well regarded among employers. It was certainly an intriguing suggestion, so I researched more about the school and visited their campus to learn more. Suffice to say, I was very much pleased with what I learned upon visiting the campus. From the accreditations that the school has received, to the high-quality facilities of the TechnoCore building, I had a strong feeling that this was going to be the next step in my self-actualization and future career. I am eager and anticipate for the many new experience that TIP holds for me.
